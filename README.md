# RememberYourFood

## Description
Our restaurant tracker is a diary that keeps track of the restaurants youâ€™ve eaten. Each entry records the title, location, date of eating there, rating, comments and photos of the food you ordered. Each entry can be placed into a collection, organized by trips, cities, or whatever else you want.  With this app, you can remember your favorite places or least places to eat from in an organized space.

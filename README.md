# RememberYourFood

## Description
Our restaurant tracker is a diary that keeps track of the restaurants you’ve eaten. Each entry records the title, location, date of eating there, rating, comments and photos of the food you ordered. Each entry can be placed into a collection, organized by trips, cities, or whatever else you want.  With this app, you can remember your favorite places or least places to eat from in an organized space.
